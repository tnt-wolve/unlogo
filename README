REQUIREMENTS
========================
- OSX Developer Tools


BUILDING
========================

An Unlogo filter is simply a BSD C Library that contains 3 functions: 

int init(const char* argstr)
int uninit()
int process(uint8_t* dst[4], int dst_stride[4],
					   uint8_t* src[4], int src_stride[4],
					   int width, int height)

UNLOGO filter uses the 'plugin' AVFilter for FFMPEG written by Michael Droese.  This greatly simplifies and speeds up the process of making a filter by allowing the user to reference a shared object when running FFMPEG rather than having to recompile all of FFMPEG with every change. So the first thing you need to do is compile a version of FFMPEG with the 'plugin' filter.   



INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
========================

To use the filter, make sure to use the version of FFMPEG that you just built, and then do something like this: 

	ffmpeg -qscale 2 -i [input video] -vf plugin=moustachizer.so -y [output file name]
